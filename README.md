This simulation is based off of the research paper "Antigenic cooperation among intrahost HCVvariants organized into a complex networkof cross-immunoreactivity" written by Pavel Skumsa, Leonid Bunimovichb, and Yury Khudyakovawhich. Its link can be found here: https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1422942112

I reproduced the results in figure 3 for A and B. I used the CR Matrices given and plugged them into equations 1 and 2, and used Euler's method to approximate the values for the antigenic variants and the immune responses. I automated the calculations using Python and plotted a graph.
